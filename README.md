This is my Java project for the OOP Basics Lab.

What Each Part Does
Activity 1 & 2: Student
What it is: A Student class that keeps track of a student's info.
In the program: It asks for your name, age, and grade, then prints it back to you.

Activity 3: Vehicle
What it is: A Vehicle class that can track a vehicle's brand, model, and speed.
In the program: It creates a car and a motorcycle. It then makes both of them "accelerate" (go faster) and prints their new speed.

Activity 4: Bank Account
What it is: A BankAccount class that holds an account name and balance.
In the program: This part lets you use a fake bank menu. You can:
Deposit money
Withdraw money
Exit
It shows you your new balance after you deposit or withdraw.

Activity 5: Circle
What it is: A Circle class that can figure out its own area and circumference from its radius.
In the program: It asks you to enter a radius (a number) for two different circles. Then, it calculates and shows you the area and circumference for both.
